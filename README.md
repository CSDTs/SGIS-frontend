SGIS 2.0

===============================

Goal :
Geographical Information System(GIS) application for school kids:

The basic idea is to provide students with different data sources that might be interesting for the kids in measuring different datasets such as neighborhood medium incomes, gun ownership, IT accessibility, grocery stores, pollution. Kids will be able to measure their neighborhood and will learn generative justice in the class by comparing how prosperous their neighborhood is. Other primary goal is to make it useful for teachers teaching kids. We will be making our system as eClassroom where teachers and students will be able to login and teachers will be able to see what tags kids have added.

Users of the system: Anyone who wants to compare his neighborhood in the state of New York will be able to use this application to add his own custom tags. It is also helpful for teachers teaching kids about generative justice. Additionally, kids will be able to compare neighborhood in the class by looking at the interactive charts corresponding to their neighborhood. 

Technology Used:
Front-end: I am using Angular (Javascript Framework) with Google Maps.
Back-end: Python Django to make API that can be used for other applications also.
D3Js will be used for making interactive charts.
